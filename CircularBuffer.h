/** TODO: complete the definition of the class CircularBuffer here
 *
 * Its constructor should take the size of the buffer as an argument
 *
 * It needs to have the functions:
 * - count() which returns how many things are in the buffer
 * - full() which returns true iff the buffer is full
 * - add() which takes an element and adds it to the buffer (you can assume the buffer is not full)
 * - remove() which removes the next element from the buffer (you can assume the buffer is not empty)
